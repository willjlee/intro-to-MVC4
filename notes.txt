----

MVC routing is similar to API routing. URLs point to a controller, action, and parameters rather than a traditional page. the "Index" method is the default action.
	/[Controller]/[ActionName]/[Parameters]

Action methods (within controllers) usually return a view. Right click inside the method and click "add view".

Views are stored by default/generation within folders named to match the associated controller. The file name matches the method name.

-SUPER USEFUL: right click on a view and click view in page inspector to see the view, rendered html and css, etc.

_Layout.cshtml (in the shared folder in views) is used for all pages. Use it for things like banners and menus you want on all pages. Views are rendered where the @RenderBody line is in _Layout.cshtml.

Note the use of ViewBag to alter the titles on pages. Individual page titles are merged into the layout's title.

You can pass information from the controller to the view using a ViewBag. preoperties can be added to a ViewBag on the fly (eg, ViewBag.numTimes can be used without ViewBag actually having a numTimes property beforehand).

@ replaces <%...%> for inserting code into html

Auto-generated code uses an alternative to the ViewBag that allows for strong typing. in the Movies views, note the @model line at the top. Defines expected parameter. Good for compile-time checking and intellisense.

To find data: show all files in solution explorer. App_Data>[db file]. Right click a table to view data. NOTE: close the connection after you finish working with this.

DO NOT modify any data within GET methods
