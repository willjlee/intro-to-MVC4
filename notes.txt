----

MVC routing is similar to API routing. URLs point to a controller, action, and parameters rather than a traditional page. the "Index" method is the default action.
	/[Controller]/[ActionName]/[Parameters]

Action methods (within controllers) usually return a view. Right click inside the method and click "add view".

Views are stored by default/generation within folders named to match the associated controller. The file name matches the method name.

-SUPER USEFUL: right click on a view and click view in page inspector to see the view, rendered html and css, etc.

_Layout.cshtml (in the shared folder in views) is used for all pages. Use it for things like banners and menus you want on all pages. Views are rendered where the @RenderBody line is in _Layout.cshtml.

Note the use of ViewBag to alter the titles on pages. Individual page titles are merged into the layout's title.

temp note: next step: "passing data from the controller to the view"
